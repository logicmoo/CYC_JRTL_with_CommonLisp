The Term Index lists only a limited number of GAFs that involve a given constant, primarily those GAFs which were asserted locally (e.g., entered by a human user).  To compute more GAFs of a given type, click on the "plus" symbol next to the desired relation.  This will activate the Literal Query tool.
<p>
<h3><a name="query">Literal Queries</a></h3>
<p>
The Literal Query tool asks CYC&reg; to try and compute (via HL modules and other means) more GAFs of the specified type; the results are displayed as follows:
<ul>
<li>"Last query" specifies which atomic formula (in which <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory>#$Microtheory</a>) is being expanded upon.
<li>"Bindings" specifies over which argument the computation is taking place (this should match the variable in the query), and displays every possible binding for that argument.
</ul>
<p>
For example, suppose <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/agent-vocab.html#Agent>#$Agent</a> is displayed in the KB Browser.  Clicking on the "genls" link in the Term Index under "Arg 1" will list only locally asserted supersets of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/agent-vocab.html#Agent>#$Agent</a>.  We can produce a list of all supersets of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/agent-vocab.html#Agent>#$Agent</a> by clicking on the green "plus" symbol next to "genls" in the Term Index; this should produce the following Literal Query:
<pre>
  Last query in BaseKB :
  (genls Agent ?ARG2)

  Bindings for ?ARG2 :
  Agent   CompositeTangibleAndIntangibleObject  
  PartiallyIntangible   PartiallyTangible   SomethingExisting  
  TemporalThing   SpatialThing   Individual   Thing      

  Examine the inference tree ... 
</pre>
The meaning of which is that <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/agent-vocab.html#Agent>#$Agent</a> has <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/top-vocab.html#PartiallyTangible>#$PartiallyTangible</a>, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/spatial-vocab.html#SpatialThing>#$SpatialThing</a>, etc. as supersets.  
<p>
"Examine the inference tree" is a link to the Inference Tree Examiner, which provides a detailed look at the inferencing performed during the search.
