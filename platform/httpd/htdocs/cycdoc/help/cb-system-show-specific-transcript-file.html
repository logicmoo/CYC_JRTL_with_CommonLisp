This page lists the filename of a selected transcript file as well as any operations which have been saved to that file.  If no operations have yet been saved, a message to that effect will appear.
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT!  A transcript file should never be edited except by an experienced Cyclist in an emergency situation.  This goes double for the master transcript.</b>  If a transcript file must be edited, be sure that:
<ul>
<li>All parentheses are balanced.
<li>Any transcript form that is removed is COMLETELY removed.  This includes the timestamp for that operation.
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="read">Reading a Transcript File</a></h4>
<p>
Operations in a transcript file are written in the order that they were recorded.  Thus, newly recorded operations will appear at the end of a transcript file.
<p>
Every operation or operation-pair is followed by a timestamp operation which records when that operation was processed.  Thus the assertion of a new formula is actually two operations (the assertion plus its timestamp), while an assertion edit is three (the deletion, reassertion, and timestamp).  The timestamp operations are included in the operation counts that appear in the Agenda Status Bar under the headings "Remote" and "Local".
<p>
Let's say user #$JoeSmith asserts (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> #$Fred HumanAdult) in the #$PeopleDateMt.  This would appear in the transcript file as:
<pre>
  (:HP "Guest" 153344) "WILLY-599-19970630100940" 19970630 
    (FI-ASSERT 
    '(
      (:HP "isa" 260) 
        (:HP "Fred" 537024) 
        (:HP "HumanAdult" 13049)) 
    '(:HP "CyclistsMt" 50975076) ':DEFAULT ':FORWARD))

  ((:HP "Guest" 153344) "WILLY-599-19970630100940" 19970630 
    (FI-TIMESTAMP-ASSERTION 
    '(:HP "JoeSmith" 537024) '19970630))
</pre>
<ul>
<li>"Guest" refers to the overall owner of the operation.  The overall owner usually be "Guest" and is nothing to be concerned about.
<li>"WILLY-599-19970630100940"  is the CYC&reg; Image on which the operation was performed.
<li>(FI-ASSERT...:FORWARD)) is the assertion itself, including Mt, truth value, and direction.  Every constant in the assertion is followed by its unique constant id.
<li>The second form is the timestamp information for the first operation.  "JoeSmith" is the performer of the operation, and "19970630" is the date on which the operation was performed.
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="load">Loading a Transcript File</a></h3>
<p>
Operations in the current local transcript can be sent to the Master Transcript simply by sending stored operations from the Communication Status Area.  However, it is sometimes desirable to load a transcript manually.  Examples of transcripts to be loaded manually include: transcripts from a previous CYC&reg; image,, transcripts containing operations that were cleared instead of being sent to the Master Transcript, or transcripts from other CYC&reg; images whose operations have never been sent to the Master Transcript, but it's desirable to have them included in the current local image.  Manually loaded transcripts can be loaded up on the local machine and sent (or not) at a later time; the user is never committed to sending operations unless the communication status is set to "Send Immediately".
<p>
To manually load a transcript file, select the "Navigator" link from the Toolbar Frame or the Browser Tools page.  Click on "Load Transcript File" in the "File Handling" section and follow the instructions there.
