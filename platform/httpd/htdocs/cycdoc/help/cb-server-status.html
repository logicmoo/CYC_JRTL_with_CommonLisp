<p>
The Agenda Status Bar provides information to the user about the current state of the CYC&reg; Agenda.  This information can be updated manually, by clicking on the "Update" link, or it can be set to update automatically ("Server Update Interval") via the Browser Options page.   This link will not appear if "Server Update Interval" has been set to an integer value on the Browser Options page, and JavaScript is turned off.  When frames are not being used, this link will update the entire page.
<p>
<h3><a name="mode">Communication Status</a></h3>
<p>
"Comm" lists the current communication status for the CYC&reg; Agenda, and is a link to the Communication Status Area, where the communications settings can be changed.  There are six possible combinations of settings, which will show up in the Status Bar:
<ul>
<li><i>Sending and Receiving:</i> send processed operations out immediately, and receive operations from others.
<li><i>Sending Only:</i> send processed operations out immediately, but do not receive operations from others.
<li><i>Storing and Receiving:</i> store processed operations for later, and receive operations from others.
<li><i>Storing Only:</i> store processed operations for later, but do not receive operations from others.
<li><i>Not Recording but Receiving:</i> don't make a record of processed operations, but receive operations from others.
<li><i>Not Recording or Receiving:</i> don't make a record of processed operations, and do not receive operations from others.
</ul>
See the <a href="cb-mode.text">Communication Status Area Help</a> page for more details on communications settings.
<p>
<h3><a name="queues">Operations Queues</a></h3>
<p>
When operations on the CYC&reg; KB are set to be processed by the CYC&reg Agenda, they are placed in queues: operations originating on other machines go on the remote queue, operations originating on the user's local machine are on the local queue.  These queues will not appear in the Agenda Status bar until there are some operations to process.
<p>
"Remote" lists the operations on the remote queue.  If only one number is listed, all operations from the remote queue have been processed locally.  If two numbers are listed, the left-hand number represents operations that have been read, but have yet to be processed.  The right-hand number (or the only number in the case where there is only one listed) represents the total number of operations processed by the current CYC&reg; image, including both remote and local operations, regardless of whether they were successful or caused an error in the Agenda.
<p>
"Local" lists the operations originating on the local queue.  If three numbers are listed, the left-hand number represents unprocessed operations, the middle represents operations processed but not yet recorded, and the right-hand number represents operations processed and recorded to the current local transcript.  Only operations that have been recorded to the local transcript will be transmitted when processed operations are sent out, either via the Communication Status Area or when "Load Transcript File" is selected from the Navigator.  If only one number is listed all local operations have been processed and recorded; however, this number will disappear if these operations are sent to the Master Transcript, since doing so will create a new Local Transcript.  If there are still operations in the local queue to be processed, "Local" will appear as an active link to the Local Operations page, where the contents of the local queue will be displayed, and the user will have the option of clearing the entire queue, if desired.
<p> 
The System Area and accompanying help page (accessible via the "System" link) provide more details about the individual queues.
<h3><a name="agenda">The CYC&reg; Agenda</a></h3> 
<p>
The CYC&reg; Agenda is the process which controls the functioning of a given CYC&reg image, including deciding which operations to process and how to handle errors during knowledge-entry (KE).
<p>
"Agenda" lists the current state of the CYC&reg; Agenda, and is a link to the Agenda Process Control, where the current agenda operation can be viewed, the Agenda can be turned on and off, and the error handling mode can be set.
<p>
The CYC&reg; Agenda can be in one of many states, depending on the type of CYC&reg image being run:
<ul>
<li>C images are not multi-threaded, and so have only two states:
  <ul>
  <li>None: agenda is not running or has halted (possibly to due to an error in the Agenda, or from never having been turned on).
  <li>Enabled: agenda has been started and is available for operations.
  </ul>
<li>Lisp and NT images are multi-threaded, so there are more possibilities:
  <ul>
  <li>None: agenda is not running or has halted (possibly to due to an error in the Agenda, or from never having been turned on).
  <li>Idle: the agenda is running but has no work to do.
  <li>Run, Running: the agenda is actually in the act of executing an operation.
  <li>Everything else: specific states idiosyncratic to various Common Lisp implementations.  While these states are explicitly listed in the Agenda Status Bar, they play no significant role in the Agenda Process Control, and so are grouped together on that page under "Running", primarily as a matter of convenience.<br>
      Some examples:
      <ul>
      <li>Probe
      <li>PMap GetPort
      <li>Selected
      <li>User Input
      <li>Arrested
      </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
The <a href="cb-agenda.html">Agenda Process Control Help</a> page explains in more detail the two major categories of settings for the CYC&reg; Agenda, Halted and Running.
<h3><a name="image">The CYC&reg; Image</a></h3>
<p>
The CYC&reg; image is the local copy of the CYC&reg program running on a given machine.  Different machines will have different CYC&reg images.
"KB" identifies the version of the Knowledge Base in use.
<p>
"System" lists the current version of the <a href="../ref/glossary.html#SubL">SubL</a> source code for the current CYC&reg; image, and is a link to the System Area, where machine and image number can be viewed, CYC&reg patches can be loaded (LISP images only), and the CYC&reg image can be halted (C images only).
