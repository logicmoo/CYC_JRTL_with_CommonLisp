<h3><a name="arguments">Assertion Arguments</a></h3>
<p>
Every assertion in the CYC&reg; KB has arguments which immediately support its existence in the KB.  This page displays a selected assertion, followed by the arguments which support it.  If an argument for an assertion is removed from the KB, then the assertion is removed as well, unless it can still be derived via other arguments.
<p>
Arguments are essentially the converse of dependents.  That is, if assertion A is an argument for assertion B, then B is a dependent of A.  For more information on dependents, see the <a href="cb-dependents.html">Dependents Help</a>.

<h3><a name="types">Local vs. Deduced Arguments</a></h3>
<p>
Assertions in CYC&reg; (as reflected by their arguments) come in two flavors: local or deduced.
<ul>
<li>Local: local assertions are those that are asserted by some source outside of CYC&reg;, most likely a human user.  Arguments for these kinds of assertions are of the form:
<pre>
  Asserted locally by Fred on Nov 25, 1996
</pre>
In other words, the displayed assertion is true because Fred asserted it.
<p>
<li>Deduced: deduced assertions are those that are derived from other knowledge in the KB.  Arguments for these kinds of assertions are of the form:
<pre>
  Argument : Deduced #10657786

    [Supporting-Argument-1]
    [Supporting-Argument-2]
</pre>
In other words, the combination of [Supporting-Argument-1] and [Supporting-Argument-2] result in the displayed assertion being concluded by CYC&reg;.  Deduced assertions cannot be deleted; instead, use the "Blast" tool accessible from the Assertion Display Frame.
<p>
If an argument for a deduced assertion originated via a special HL-module, the name of that module (e.g. :ISA) will apppear in place of the standard colored ball in front of the argument. 
<p>
Clicking on the "Deduced" link will display the argument source in more detail.
</ul>
