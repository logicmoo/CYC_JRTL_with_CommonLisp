The Browser History provides a list of constants and assertions that have been recently accessed by the current user in the current CYC&reg; image.
<p>
Clicking on the "Clear History" link will remove all constants and assertions that are currently in the KB Browser History, returning the Browser History to its initial state.
<p>
The KB Browser History is divided into two sections:
<ul>
<li>"Recent Constants": lists the CYC&reg; constants most recently viewed in this CYC&reg image.
<p>
<li>"Recent Assertions": lists the CYC&reg; assertions most recently viewed in this CYC&reg image.
</ul>
