This page allows the user to create a new CYC&reg; constant.
<p>
<h3><a name="create">Creating New Constants</a></h3>
To create a new constant in the KB, enter the name the new constant will have (minus the "#$&quot;), then press the [<i>Create Constant</i>] button. If a constant already exists by that name, a message will appear to that effect.  Once a new constant is created, don't forget to assert defining information about it, including an english <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#comment>#$comment</a>.
<p>
To see if any existing constants have similar beginnings, enter the intial part of the name into the window and press the [<i>Complete</i>] button.  Possible completions will be displayed in a separate completion window which will be reused for future completions. Completion is case sensitive, and requires that JavaScript is enabled in your browser.
<p> 
To clear the window and start again, press the [<i>Clear</i>] button.
<p>
To abort out of the create constant option and return to the previous frame, press the [<i>Cancel Create</i>] button.
