This page provides a little more detail about the argument sources for a deduced assertion than the Arguments page.
<p>
The detailed description of an argument source contains three sections: 
<ul>
<li>"Assertion Supported" is the assertion which is derived by CYC&reg; from the arguments which follow.
<li>"Argument Truth" is the truth value and strength of the argument provided.
<li>"Argument Supports" are the assertions in CYC&reg; whose combination resulted in the assertion at the top of the page being concluded by CYC&reg.
</ul>
<p>
If an argument for a deduced assertion originated via a special HL-module, the name of that module (e.g. :ISA) will apppear in place of the standard colored ball in front of the argument.
