<h3><a name="indices">Auxiliary Indices</a></h3>
<p>
Most uses of the CYC&reg; KB Browser involve using the standard Term
Index for viewing assertions involving a displayed constant.  However,
in addition to this main index, there may be several other indices
available for viewing assertions, depending on the version of CYC&reg;
being used.  These indices, if available, are listed on the Auxiliary
Indices page.
<p>
To select an auxiliary index, simply click on its name in the list.
The Main Display Frame will appear as usual, but the indexing
scheme/content will be different.
<p>
To return to the standard Term Index, simply choose a constant to
display, either through the Toolbar or by clicking on the highlighted
constant.  If the constant cannot be displayed via the selected
auxiliary index (most cannot), the standard Term Index will be used.
