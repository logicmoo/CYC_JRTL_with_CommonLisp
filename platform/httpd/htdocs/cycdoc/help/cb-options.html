This page allows the user to set interface options for the KB Browser.  These options are persistent for a given CYC&reg; Image, NOT for a given CYC&reg user.  To save settings changes, read the Interface Settings section below.

<h3><a name="general">General Options</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Server Update Interval:</b> setting this option to an integer value causes the Agenda Status Bar to be automatically updated in intervals of the specified number of seconds.  It may be necessary to refresh the KB Browser or click on the "Update" link in the Agenda Status Bar one final time to activate this option.  Leaving the input field blank (the default value) disables the automatic update; the Agenda Status Bar must then be updated manually be clicking on the "Update" link when an update is desired.
<li><b>Wrap Assertions:</b> clicking on this option causes assertions to wrap when displayed by the KB Browser.  The default value is for no wrap to occur, which allows more assertions to be displayed at one time, but may inhibit viewing of an entire axiom due to length.
<li><b>Wrap Interactor and Ask input boxes:</b> clicking on this options causes text in the large text input windows (e.g Interactor, Ask, Assert, Edit) to wrap automatically.  The default value is for no wrap to occur.
<li><b>Show assertions in English:</b> clicking on this option causes assertions to be displayed in generated English, as opposed to CycL (the default).  This option can also be set in the "NL Tools" section of the CYC&reg; Navigator".
<li><b>Display current MT:</b> clicking on this option turns on the <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory>#$Microtheory</a> filter tool, causing a special "ViewMt" link to appear in the Term Index.  Using the "ViewMt" link to set a microtheory filter will cause only those assertions in the specified microtheory to be listed in the Term Index.
<li><b>Interface Settings:</b> it is possible to save preferred KB Browser settings in a file for later use.  To do this, click on "Save Interface Settings" to go to the Save Interface State page.  For help with saving the settings to a file, look at <a href="cb-save-interface-state.html">Save Interface State Help</a>.  To invoke KB Browser settings which have been saved previously, click on "Restore Interface Settings" to go to the Restor Interface State page.  For help with restoring the settings from a file, look at <a href="cb-restore-interface-state.html">Restore Interface State Help</a>.
<li><b>Frames and JavaScript:</b> to use HTML frames and JavaScript while using the KB Browser, make sure both buttons are clicked.  Both are recommended and are set as default values.  Unfortunately, some HTML browsers do not yet support HTML frames and/or JavaScript.  If this is the case with your browser, unclick the relevant option to see a more basic version of the KB Browser.
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="constant">Constant Options</a></h3>
<p>
The constant options affect how a CYC&reg; constant is displayed in the Browser, not the KB Browser in general.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Default Content:</b> this option sets what kind of information is displayed for a given constant when that constant is first selected.  It is only possibly to choose one of the listed options at a time.
  <ul>
  <li><b>As much as possible up to __ assertions:</b> will display as many assertions as possible up to the number specified, regardless of type of assertion.
  <li><b>Documentation:</b> will display documentation assertions about the constant, including <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#comment>#$comment</a>, etc.
  <li><b>Definitional Information:</b> will display assertions considered definitional for the constant, such as <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a>, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genls>#$genls</a>, etc; will also display whether a constant is "public" or "mentioned in code".
  <li><b>Lexical Information:</b> will display lexical information about the constant, including <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/lexicon-vocab.html#denotation>#$denotation</a>, etc.
  </ul>
</ul>
