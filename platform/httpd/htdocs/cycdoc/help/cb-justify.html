<h3><a name"just-v-arg">Justification vs. Arguments</a></h3>
<p>
The Justify tool is very similar to the Arguments tool in that it displays the arguments that support the displayed assertion.  However, the Arguments tool only displays those arguments which immediately support the displayed assertion, while Justify provides the entire chain of arguments which together imply the displayed assertion.  The Justify tool starts with the displayed assertion, finds its immediate arguments, finds the arguments' arguments, and so on until it reaches only local assertions (assertions whose source is outside of CYC&reg;, e.g., something directly asserted by a human CYC&reg; user).
<p>
For information about the Arguments tool, see the <a href="cb-arguments.text">Arguments Help"</a> page.

<h3><a name="justify">Assertion Justifications</a></h3>
<p>
This page first displays the assertion supported, followed by its justification.  The justification is listed from most immediate argument to least immediate, indenting each time it goes back another level.  A typical justification might be structured as follows:
<pre>
Argument : Deduced #11997313

    [Main-Argument-1]
    [Main-Argument-2]
        Argument : Deduced #3565200
            [Sub-Argument-A]
            [Sub-Argument-B]
</pre>
Here, [Sub-Argument-A] and [Sub-Argument-B] are assertions which support [Main-Argument-2].  Since [Main-Argument-1], [Sub-Argument-A], and [Sub-Argument-B] are all leaf nodes of the justification tree (no arguments are listed for them), they must be local assertions.
<p>
Clicking on any of the "Deduced" links will display in more detail the argument source for the assertion it follows.  So in the example above, clicking on "Deduced #3565200" will display the argument source for [Main-Argument-2], while "Deduced #11997313" is a link to the argument source for the main assertion.
