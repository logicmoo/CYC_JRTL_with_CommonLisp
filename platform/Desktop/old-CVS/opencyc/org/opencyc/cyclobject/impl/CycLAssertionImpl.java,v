 * KB comment for #$CycLAssertion as of 2002/05/07:<p>
 *
 * The collection of semantically well-formed #$CycLSentences asserted to the
 * Cyc Knowledge Base.  Each instance of #$CycLAssertion is either (1) an
 * #$HLAssertion: a Heuristic Level CycL sentence reified in the Cyc Knowledge
 * Base (i.e. a CycL sentence that corresponds to a data structure actually in
 * the Cyc KB), or (2) an #$ELAssertion: an Epistemological Level CycL sentence
 * that can be canonicalized into one or more already extant #$HLAssertions.
 * #$CycLAssertion is used as an argument type constraint for certain
 * meta-predicates, such as #$overrides.<p>
