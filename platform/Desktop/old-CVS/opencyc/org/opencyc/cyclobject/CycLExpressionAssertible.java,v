/*****************************************************************************
 * KB comment for #$CycLExpression-Assertible as of 2002/05/07:<p>
 *
 * A #$CycLExpressionType.  The collection of all compound CycL expressions that
 * either could themselves be asserted to the Cyc Knowledge Base (see
 * #$CycLSentence-Assertible) or could appear as non-atomic terms within
 * sentences that could be so asserted (see #$CycLNonAtomicTerm-Assertible).
 * More precisely, each instance of #$CycLExpression-Assertible is a CycL
 * expression that is both syntactically and semantically well-formed.  By
 * definition, any compound CycL expression is syntactically well-formed.  To be
 * semantically well-formed, a CycL expression must be constructible via the
 * syntax of CycL without violating any applicable arity or argument-type
 * constraints (see #$arity and #$ArgTypePredicate).  A CycL formula must be
 * semantically well-formed in order to be interpretable as having a "semantic
 * value", such as a truth-value (if the formula is a sentence) or a denotation
 * (if it's a #$CycLDenotationalTerm).  Note that being "assertible" in the
 * present sense does not require an expression's actually being asserted in (or
 * being a component of something asserted in) the KB.<p>

@Initial check in of CycL objects, an alternative to org.cycobject.* classes, in
those cases where closer alignment to the CycL grammar is required.
