/*****************************************************************************
 * KB comment for #$CycLNonAtomicTerm as of 2002/05/07:<p>
 *
 * The collection of non-atomic denotational terms in the CycL language.  A CycL
 * term is _non-atomic_ if it constructible from other CycL terms via the syntax
 * of CycL.  A CycL term is said to be "denotational" if it is the type of term
 * that can have a denotatum (or assigned value; see #$CycLDenotationalTerm).
 * #$CycLNonAtomicTerm thus includes all CycL denotational terms except
 * constants and variables.  A CycL non-atomic term (or "NAT") consists of a
 * CycL expression denoting a #$Function-Denotational followed by one or more
 * CycL terms, with the entire sequence enclosed in parentheses.  The NAT itself
 * denotes the value (if any) of this function for the denotations of the other
 * terms taken as arguments.  (If there is no such value then the NAT has no
 * denotatum; see #$undefined.)  NATs are also known as "denotational formulas",
 * in contrast to "logical formulas" (i.e. sentences). Currently, there are two
 * main types of NAT: (i) #$HLNonAtomicReifiedTerms (or "NART"s), which are a
 * type of #$HLReifiedDenotationalTerm and are implemented with data structures
 * that have indexing that enables all uses of the NAT to be retrieved, and (ii)
 * #$ELNonAtomicTerms (or "NAUT"s), which have no such indexing and remain in
 * the form of an EL expression in the assertions in which they occur.<p>

@Initial check in of CycL objects, an alternative to org.cycobject.* classes, in
