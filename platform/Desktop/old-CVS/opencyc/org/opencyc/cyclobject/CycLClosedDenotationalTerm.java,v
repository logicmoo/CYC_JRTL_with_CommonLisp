 * KB comment for #$CycLClosedDenotationalTerm as of 2002/05/07:<p>
 *
 * The collection of all closed denotational terms in the CycL language.  An
 * expression is said to be "closed" if it contains no free variables (see
 * #$CycLClosedExpression).  A CycL term is said to be "denotational" if it is
 * the right sort of term to have a denotation (or value) in the universe of
 * discourse (see #$CycLDenotationalTerm).  CycL sentences, while terms of CycL,
 * are not considered denotational terms.  Each instance of
 * #$CycLClosedDenotationalTerm is either a #$CycLClosedAtomicTerm (i.e. a
 * #$CycLConstant or #$SubLAtomicTerm) or a #$CycLClosedNonAtomicTerm (i.e. a
 * "NAT" with no free variables).  Examples of closed denotational terms include
 * `#$Muffet', `(#$JuvenileFn #$Dog)', `(#$TheSetOf ?X (#$objectHasColor ?X
 * GreenColor))', and `212'.  Note that these are also examples:
 * `(#$BorderBetweenFn #$Canada #$Mexico)' (despite the fact that it fails
 * actually to denote anything) and `(#$JuvenileFn #$isa #$genls #$JuvenileFn)'
 * (despite the fact that it is not semantically well-formed).<p>

@Initial check in of CycL objects, an alternative to org.cycobject.* classes, in
those cases where closer alignment to the CycL grammar is required.
