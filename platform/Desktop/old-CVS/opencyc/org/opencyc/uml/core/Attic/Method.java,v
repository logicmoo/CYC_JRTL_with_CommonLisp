/**
 * Method from the UML Common_Behavior package.
 *
 * A method is the implementation of an operation.  It specifies the
 * algorithm or procedure that effects the results of an operation.
 *
 * In the metamodel, a Method is a declaration of a named piece of
 * behavior in a Classifier and realizes one (directly) or a set
 * (indirectly) of Operations of the Classifier.
