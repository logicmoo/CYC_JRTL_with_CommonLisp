      <title>Thank You!</title>
      <p>
        In this place we want to say thank you to everybody that is/was somehow
        involved  in this project. Even if you did not end up here, whether it was
        just a few comments,  criticism, some good ideas, patience, software to
        build on or build with, or lines  of code, you have all taken part in 
        making this project a working reality. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Below you can find a list of people which have significantly contributed to 
        the project by working long and hard to make quality software for the rest 
        of  the world to use. 
      </p>
