      Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) is free software, and comes with
absolutely no warranty. SBCL is derived from CMU CL, which was
released into the public domain, subject only to the BSD-style
&quot;free, but credit must be given and copyright notices must be
retained&quot; licenses in the LOOP macro (from MIT and Symbolics)
and in the PCL implementation of CLOS (from Xerox). After CMU
CL was was released into the public domain, it was maintained
by volunteers, who continued the tradition of releasing their
work into the public domain. All changes to SBCL since the fork
from CMU CL have been released into the public domain in jurisdictions
where this is possible, or under the FreeBSD licence where not.
Thus, there are no known obstacles to copying, using, and modifying
SBCL freely, as long as copyright notices of MIT, Symbolics,
Xerox and Gerd Moellmann are retained.
