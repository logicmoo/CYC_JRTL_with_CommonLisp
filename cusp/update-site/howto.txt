These steps should be automated sometime, but now it all goes as follows:

1. Check out the following projects into Eclipse:
  - cusp_update
  - jasko.tim.lisp
  - jasko.tim.lisp.feature
  - jasko.tim.lisp.libs
  - jasko.tim.lisp.libs.feature
  - sbcl-linux
  - sbcl-linux.feature
  - sbcl-ocx
  - sbcl-ocx.feature
  - sbcl-win32
  - sbcl-win32.feature
  - sbcl.installer
  
2. If sbcl.installer is modified, then open its manifest.mf and select Export wizard.
Export to jar file and copy that file to sbcl-linux.feature, sbcl-osx.feature and 
sbcl-win32.feature as sbcl.installer.jar

3. To update sbcl: 
  - replace sbcl.zip (for linux and osx) or sbcl.msi (for win32)
by updated version
  - go to corresponding feature.xml and update version number
  - go to meta-inf subfolder of the plugin folder (the folder containing sbcl.zip/.mci),
open manifest.mf and update version number

Note: leave os and architecture fields empty, otherwise eclipse will not
build plugins for other architectures

4. To update site cusp_update, go to site.xml and hit Build all.

5. This doesn't work:
Finally fix architecture and os. For this unpack jar file for an sbcl version,
modify feature.xml to reflect os and architecture by adding as last two attributes of
feature tag (as in <feature id="sbcl_linux" label="SBCL-Linux" version="1.0.15">):
      os="aix,hpux,linux,macosx,qnx,solaris,win32"
      arch="ia64,ia64_32,PA_RISC,ppc,sparc,x86,x86_64">
(leave only appropriate os and architecture in above strings)

LAST UPDATE: sbcl features are no longer provided - use binary packages
from sbcl site.


-- add architecture and os to sbcl-os.feature, right click on feature.xml, pde tools, create
ant build file, run as ant -> get error, go to temp folder inside feature folder, zip it and change
extension to jar, copy to features on update site
