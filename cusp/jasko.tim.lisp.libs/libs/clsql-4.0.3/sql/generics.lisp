QUERY-EXPRESSION. If RESULT-TYPES is nil all results are returned
as strings whereas the default value of :auto means that the lisp
types are automatically computed for each field. FIELD-NAMES is t
by default which means that the second value returned is a list
of strings representing the columns selected by
QUERY-EXPRESSION. If FIELD-NAMES is nil, the list of column names
is not returned as a second value. FLATP has a default value of
nil which means that the results are returned as a list of
lists. If FLATP is t and only one result is returned for each
record selected by QUERY-EXPRESSION, the results are returned as
elements of a list."))
