============== Test on Linux (Fedora VMWare) with cusp 0.9.375 and sbcl 1.0.20
Ganymede


----- chunga-0.4.3 - Drakma dependency - check if Drackma works
- compiled
- works ?
checked by Drackma?

----- cl-base64-3.3.2 - skiped testing - I think it is used by other libraries
- compiled

----- cl-fad-0.6.2 - Works
- compiled
- to test: load package.
(load "D:/docums/code/eclipse/jasko.tim.lisp.libs/libs/cl-fad-0.6.2/test.lisp")
(cl-fad-test::test)
Get All tests passed.

----- cl-interpol-0.2.1 - Works (all tests pass)
- compiled
- to test: (asdf:oos 'asdf:test-op 'cl-interpol)


----- cl-ppcre-2.0.0 - Works
- compiled
- to test: (asdf:oos 'asdf:test-op 'cl-ppcre)


----- cl-smtp - Need smtp server to check if it works
- compiled
- didn't test



----- clsql 4.0.3 - Works (at least with sqlite3 and mysql) uses uffi, so checks that too
- compiled
- to test: 
shell>sqlite3 ex1 (then just quit - should create empty database in home)
get mysql: I installed 5.0.45-6.fc7.i386.rpm / also get development package

copy file .clsql-test.config into home directory


(asdf:oos 'asdf:test-op 'clsql)
didn't work - had to go to \jasko.tim.lisp.libs\libs\clsql-4.0.3\uffi folder and run make
then find libsqlite3.so and sqlite3.so (not perfect matches on names) and copy them
into uffi folder.

All tests pass. Some tests are skiped since sqlite3 does not support them.

also need to run make in db-mysql folder

---------- this is from Win32, still some is relevant
FIXME: cannot make it run with mysql! it just cannotfind clsql_mysql.dll. But people were able to run it so find out what is going on.
- testing mysql. Download and setup mysql (full setup) (enter password for root)
Test: c:\>mysql -u root -p. Change root pass to "secret" as in config file, or change config file.
Also create empty database ex1:
mysql> set password for 'root'@'localhost' = password('secret');
mysql> create database ex1;


----- cl-unicode 0.1.1 - Works
- compiled
- testing: (asdf:oos 'asdf:test-op 'cl-unicode)


----- cl-utilities-1.2.4 - Works, but for tests requires FiveAM to test,
FiveAM requires ARNESI - arnesi does not compile
- compiled
- to test: manually - pain. - just couple tests
load package, change package to cl-utilities
run tests expressions from tests.lisp

----- cl-who-0.11.1 - Works
- compiled
- testing: after loading library run, get to cl-who package and run examples
(in place of *html-stream* use (*standard-output* nil :prologue t)

----- closure-common-2007-10-21 is dependency of cxml - don't test it directly

----- cxml-2007-10-21
- compiled
- testing: after loading: (asdf:operate 'asdf:test-op :cxml) - did not do anything - try examples?
(with-open-file (s "/home/sk/tmp/example.xml" :direction :output)
    (write-string "<test a='b'><child/></test>" s))

(defparameter *example* (cxml:parse-file "c:/temp/example.xml" (cxml-dom:make-dom-builder)))
(dom:document-element *example*)
* (dom:tag-name (dom:document-element *example*))
"test"
* (dom:child-nodes (dom:document-element *example*))
#(#<DOM-IMPL::ELEMENT child @ #x722b6d8a>)

* (dom:get-attribute (dom:document-element *example*) "a")

- I have not figured out how to run test file.
I used http://berlinbrowndev.blogspot.com/2008/07/enterprise-common-lisp-setting-up.html

(hunchentoot:start-server :port 4242) then going to http://localhost:4242/ in webbrowser shows
hunchentoot default page,

------- lisp_webapp_example (requires mysql) - testing hunchentoot
adjust the following path to path where index.html is located
(setq html-template:*default-template-pathname* 
	  #P"c:\\projects\\tools\\home\\projects\\aaageneralprojects\\haskellnotebook\\lisp\\webapp\\")
see later:
